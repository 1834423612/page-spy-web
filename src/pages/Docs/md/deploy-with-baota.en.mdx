PageSpy supports one-click deployment in the Baota Panel's Docker appstore.

### Prerequisites#prerequire

Install the Baota Panel by visiting the [Baota Panel](https://www.bt.cn/new/index.html) official website and selecting the appropriate script for installation.

### Installation#install

1. Go to "Docker - App Store," find PageSpy, and click install.

2. Set the basic information and click "Confirm."

3. The panel will automatically initialize the app, which takes about 1 minute. After initialization, the service will be accessible via port 6752.

### Configuration of Domain and Other Information (Important)

This section is for users who want to **bind a domain for access** and **use Auth authentication** for authorized access.  
This documentation is valid for the current Baota version `v9.4.0` and earlier versions. Future versions may fix this issue.

> **Why is this configuration needed?**  
> For unknown reasons, if you configure through the "Docker - Website" section in the Baota Panel using "HTTP Authentication" and other methods, the PageSpy service will not be accessible.  
> You can refer to this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/HuolalaTech/page-spy-web/issues/310) to understand the problem.  
> Including but not limited to:
> - Configured root directory `/` HTTP authentication works, but SDK calls result in 401 errors.
> - For unknown reasons, configuring `/#/room-list` or `/room-list/` does not trigger the authentication popup.
> - Unable to add Nginx configuration files, making it impossible to bypass authentication for certain public requests like `/api`, `/page-spy`, `/plugin`, etc.
> Therefore, the following seemingly cumbersome configuration method is provided to ensure that the PageSpy service is accessible and can be authenticated through Auth.

1. First, create an `htpasswd` file to store the username and password. Execute the following command in the terminal to generate an `htpasswd` file.  
```bash
htpasswd -c /www/server/pass/yourDomain.com/Auth.htpasswd yourUsername
```
Replace `yourDomain.com` with your domain or save it to another location, and replace `yourUsername` with your username.  
After generation, you will be prompted to enter a password. **If the command line indicates that htpasswd is not found, use the following method to generate it online.**

2. Generate the `htpasswd` file online.  
You can search for `online htpasswd generator` in your browser and use an online tool. Here is an example of one such tool.  
<img src={GenerateHtpasswd} />  
Fill in the username and password, select the `Crypt` algorithm, and then save the generated content to the directory file from the previous step, such as `/www/server/pass/yourDomain.com/Auth.htpasswd`.

3. Go to "Docker - Website" and ensure that no domain is bound to the current PageSpy container. If there is, please delete it first.  
<img src={BaotaDockerWebsiteNone} />

4. Go to "Website - PHP Project" and add a new site, fill in the domain information, and select the PHP version as `Pure Static`.  
<img src={BaotaWebsiteCreate} />

5. Edit the site, find `Reverse Proxy`, then `Add Reverse Proxy`, customize a name, and fill in the proxy address as `http://localhost:6752` or `http://127.0.0.1:6752`, and save.

6. Find the newly created reverse proxy, click `Configuration File`, and then modify it according to the following code and image example, and save.  
You need to modify one place, change `location ^~ /` to `location /`.  
Then insert two pieces of content.  
> Refer to [FAQ - How to add some security authentication protection to the debugging end so that developers can access it through authentication?](./faq#basic-auth).  

```nginx
#PROXY-START/
# Modify the following (fourth line of the Baota configuration file) "location ^~ /" to "location /"
location /
{
   #......other configurations
   auth_basic "Please enter username and password to access PageSpy service";
   auth_basic_user_file /www/server/pass/yourDomain.com/Auth.htpasswd;
}

# Add the following content
location ~ /(api|page-spy|plugin) {
   proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6752;
   proxy_http_version    1.1;
   proxy_set_header      Upgrade $http_upgrade;
   proxy_set_header      Connection "upgrade";
}
#PROXY-END/
```
<img src={BaotaWebsiteEditReverseProxy} />

7. Done, now you can access the PageSpy frontend through your domain for testing :)
